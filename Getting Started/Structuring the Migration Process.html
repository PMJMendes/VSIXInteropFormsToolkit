            <strong>Context</strong></p>
        <p>
            Many companies continue to rely on Visual Basic 6.0 applications to support their
            businesses. Microsoft has provided tools and guidance to help with the migration
            of code from Visual Basic 6.0 to Visual Basic .NET that provides a smooth migration
            process for much of that code. For Visual Basic 6.0 forms-based applications, however,
            the migration experience&nbsp;can be&nbsp;less than optimal due to the differences
            between the Visual Basic 6.0 and WinForms engines.&nbsp; In addition, the heavy
            reliance on third-party controls by many Visual Basic 6.0 forms-based applications
            adds to the complexity and number of&nbsp;issues faced when attempting to convert
            the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reality is that for all but the most basic forms-based applications the&nbsp;best
            approach for migration is to create a new application in Visual Basic .NET and migrate
            the functionality from the Visual Basic 6.0 application to the .NET application
            manually. For many organizations, this is simply not an option for the following
            reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>'All or Nothing' Model Not Always Acceptable:</strong> There may not be
                    a business (or technological) justification for migrating 100% of an application's
                    forms to .NET. Some organizations may want/need to continue leveraging their existing
                    investment in Visual Basic 6.0 Forms and augment that investment with new functionality
                    developed in .NET.
                    <li><strong>Unacceptable Conversion Timeline:</strong> Migrating a large forms-based
                        application from Visual Basic 6.0 to Visual Basic .NET can often take&nbsp;several
                        months of development and testing. The timeline could be longer if functional changes
                        or enhancements are included in the migration. Many organizations can not afford
                        to go this long between releases of their LOB applications.
                        <li><strong>Unacceptable Risk:</strong> Even if the code is converted from Visual Basic
                            6.0 to .NET using a conversion tool, for many organizations it is an unacceptable
                            level of risk to port an entire application from Visual Basic 6.0 to Visual Basic
                            .NET in a single step. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The primary goal of this Toolkit is to provide guidance and tools to help customers
            build Hybrid Applications that will enable them to migrate their Visual Basic 6.0
            forms-based applications to .NET in a phased manner that is aligned with both the
            business and technology drivers.</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Divide And Conquer</strong></p>
        <p>
            When deciding how to migrate an application, you must identify which pieces will
            be moved to .NET in a given phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From both a design and debugging
            standpoint, the easiest way to proceed is to define logical <a href="../Reference/glossary.html">
                subsystem</a>s of functionality.&nbsp; Each subsystem contains forms that are
            closely related in business functionality, and have the most intimate relationships
            and points of connectivity. Breaking an application into subsystems minimizes the
            amount of communication that must flow through the Interop layer and therefore provides
            a simpler development experience.&nbsp; In the installed <a href="../Sample Applications/Line of Business Hybrid Application.html">
                Hybrid Sample Application</a>, Product, Order and Customer subsystems have been
            defined.&nbsp;This exemplifies&nbsp;one subsystem that remains all Visual Basic
            6.0 code, one that is made of both Visual Basic 6.0 and .NET components, and one
            that has been fully migrated to .NET, respectively.</p>
        <p>
            <strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cross-Subsystem Communication</strong></p>
        <p>
            While one goal should be to minimize the amount of interoperability points, different
            subsystems can still communicate with each other.&nbsp; When communicating from
            Visual Basic 6.0 to .NET, methods and properties should be called.&nbsp; When communicating
            from .NET to Visual Basic 6.0, events should be raised.&nbsp; Some events make sense
            to be raised directly from a form, e.g. in response to user interaction. Other events,
            especially those that communicate a change in application state, may come from non-Form
            objects.&nbsp; For information on raising events from .NET Forms see <a href="../How To/How To Create a Form Event.html">
                How to Create&nbsp;a Custom Event</a>. For information on raising events from
            .NET Forms see <a href="../How To/How To Raise an Application-Level Event.html">How to&nbsp;Raise
                an Application-Level Event</a>.
