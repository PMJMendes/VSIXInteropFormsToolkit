<p><strong>When should I use an Interop UserControl vs an
InteropForm?</strong></p>
<p>Both InteropForms and Interop UserControls allow you to put .NET content in
your Visual Basic 6.0 application, but they do so in different ways. The
advantage of Interop UserControls is that you can extend your Visual Basic 6.0
applications within the same form. InteropForms work well when you want to add
an entirely new screen to your application, while UserControls are better
suited to adding .NET content to an existing form.</p>
<p>UserControls are also the best solution for Visual Basic 6.0 MDI forms — you
can't use an InteropForm as an MDI child, but you can create an Interop
UserControl and add it to an MDI child.</p>
<p>Some key differences to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>InteropForms use an attribute-based approach. To expose properties,
    methods and&nbsp;events to your Visual Basic 6.0 application, use the
    <strong>&lt;InteropProperty&gt;</strong> attribute and click
    <strong>Tools</strong>-&gt;<strong>Generate InteropForm Wrapper
    Classes</strong>. With Interop UserControls, you simply need to make the
    members <strong>Public</strong> and then build in order for Visual Basic
    6.0 to see them; there is no need to click
    <strong>Tools</strong>-&gt;<strong>Generate</strong> InteropForm Wrapper
    Classes.</li>
    <li>Interop UserControls can only be used in the <strong>Visual Basic 6.0
    Interop UserControl Library</strong> template, and InteropForms can only be
    used in the <strong>Visual Basic 6.0 InteropForm Library</strong> template.
    If you want to use both in a Visual Basic 6.0 application, you’ll need to
    build a solution that contains one project for Forms and one project for
    UserControls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The events aren’t firing on my Interop UserControl, what do I
do?</strong></p>
<p>The mechanism for handling events on UserControls is different from
Forms.&nbsp;For more information, see&nbsp;<a href=
"../How To/Interop User Control Events.html">How To: Handle Interop UserControl
Events</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I&nbsp;create control arrays of Interop
UserControls?</strong></p>
<p>On a machine that has the .NET Framework 3.5 installed (even if you’re using
the 2.0 framework), control arrays&nbsp;will work. The functionality to support
this was not present in the .NET Framework 2.0. As a workaround you can either
create multiple controls or use a <strong>VBControlExtender</strong> to
dynamically add Interop UserControls to your form.</p>
<p><strong>When building my project, I get the following error: “Unable to copy
file "obj\Release\MyUserControl.dll" to
"bin\Release\MyUserControl.dll"</strong></p>
<p>The process cannot access the file 'bin\Release\MyUserControl.dll' because
it is being used by another process. This usually means that the DLL is in use
by Visual Basic 6.0. In order to rebuild the UserControl, the Visual Basic 6.0
project that uses it must be closed. What you can do is set your <strong>Build
Action</strong> in .NET to automatically load the Visual Basic 6.0 project,
making it more convenient to work with the two projects at once. For more
information on setting this up, see&nbsp;<a href=
"../How To/How%20To%20Debug%20a%20Hybrid%20Application.html">How To: Debug a Hybrid
Application</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I handle Exceptions raised from the .NET side?</strong></p>
<p>In order to use Visual Basic 6.0-style error handling to handle .NET
exceptions, you can use the standard <strong>On Error</strong> syntax around
any calls to Interop components (for example a public method on an Interop
UserControl).</p>
<p>This approach works well when the .NET code that&nbsp;caused the exception
was explicitly called by Visual Basic 6.0 (For example, when&nbsp;a Visual
Basic 6.0 method is on the call stack). However, there may be situations
however where an exception is raised on the .NET side due to a user’s action
(For example,&nbsp;clicking a button on an Interop UserControl). In this case
throwing an exception directly will result in the .NET Unhandled Exception
dialog (since the code that invoked the exception does not have Visual Basic
6.0 code in the underlying call stack).</p>
<p>For this situation it’s important to ensure that all your .NET code has
<strong>Try/Catch/Finally</strong> blocks around it. When you catch an
exception that you want to notify Visual Basic 6.0 about, use the
<strong>RaiseApplicationEvent</strong> method on the
<strong>EventMessenger</strong> class to notify Visual Basic 6.0 about the
problem. For more information, see <a href=
"../How To/How%20To%20Raise%20an%20Application-Level%20Event.html">How To: Raise an
Application-Level Event</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize, if the exception occurs in .NET code that was explicitly
invoked by Visual Basic 6.0 code, you can use <strong>On Error</strong> on the
Visual Basic 6.0 side and the <strong>Throw</strong> statement on the .NET
side. If the exception occurs in .NET code that was explicitly invoked by the
user, you must use the <strong>RaiseApplicationEvent</strong> method and then
handle the resulting event on the Visual Basic 6.0 side.</p>
